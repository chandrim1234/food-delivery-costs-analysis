# food-delivery-costs-analysis

The uploaded Jupyter Notebook is successfully loaded. It appears to be structured with a combination of markdown and code cells that likely describe and analyze data related to food delivery costs. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

### Analysis Description

1. **Introduction and Objectives**:
   - The notebook likely starts with markdown cells introducing the analysis objectives, such as understanding factors affecting food delivery costs.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Initial steps include loading and inspecting datasets to understand the structure and distribution of the data.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) might involve visualizations, descriptive statistics, or summaries.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Identifying missing, inconsistent, or outlier data and applying transformations to prepare the dataset for analysis.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creating or transforming features that may influence delivery costs, such as delivery distance, time of day, or order type.

5. **Statistical and Predictive Analysis**:
   - Implementing models or statistical tests to determine significant variables impacting costs.
   - Model evaluation metrics may be included if predictive analytics is performed.

6. **Visualizations**:
   - Graphs, charts, or other visual aids to present findings intuitively.
   - Tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly may be used.

7. **Conclusions and Recommendations**:
   - Summarizing key insights from the analysis.
   - Offering actionable recommendations for optimizing delivery costs.

8. **Code Structure**:
   - The notebook alternates between code execution and markdown explanations to maintain clarity and logical flow.
